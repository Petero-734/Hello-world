# Hello-world
A first journey through programming
The first project is a webpage my personal profile 
My name is Petero. I speak machine language fluently. I enjoy coding, because its basically talking to a machine but even better giving it instructions. 
What is mind blowing is that I am a machine just like it. 
Isnt it kind of  weird that I am a machine that can program other machines
